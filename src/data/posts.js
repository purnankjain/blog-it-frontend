    title: 'Detecting click outside component using React hooks'
    , id: 1
    , content: 'If you have tried developing your own dropdown, modal, or popover in React, you would have come across this. “How do I detect a click outside my react component so that I can close it?” Detecting click outside component is luckily is not that difficult. This post will use react hooks to implement this functionality.'

    , content: 'Protocol buffers or Protobuf, is a binary format that was created by Google to serialize structured data that is transferred among services. Before we get into what protocol buffers are, let us first look into JSON. JSON clearly has great advantages when it comes to being a data interchange format such as'

    title: 'Common Data Distributions for Data Science'
    , id: 5
    , content: 'Data distributions lie at the heart of all the machine learning algorithms and data science techniques. A machine learning algorithm is only as good as the data it gets. Hence, it is important to fully understand the data and data distributions before we build our models. Consequently, explore and understand its shape, size, nature, and relevance. Figuring out such details about the data helps us make informed decisions. It can help us figure out which algorithm to use. Which data pre-processing techniques to employ. How is the new data likely to impact the existing one. The list is practically endless. In this article, we will try and understand one such aspect – the shape of the data.'
